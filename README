This program was optimized for Window Maker 0.50.0+.
If you have problem using it with another version of
Window Maker then I suggest you to change to another
version of this program. wterm 6.1 works fine with
Window Maker 0.20.3 and can be grabbed on Largo's
http://wm.current.nu/files.php#wterm
an anonymous coder

PS: credits to Chiasa Aonuma, Kristy Yang (Yang Kung Ru)
and friends in #windowmaker for happiness.
(no,  Chiasa Aonuma, Kristy Yang (Yang Kung Ru) are not coders!
they are actresses who provided happiness for anonymous coder
while he coded!)

wterm.tiff was designed by an anonymous artist and nobody
are allowed to rip it <HEHEHEH>
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Tested parameter :)
./configure --enable-transparency --enable-next-scroll 
--enable-xpm-background  (all on by default)

The reason for splitting development from rxvt is that someone thrown
next style menu in it and that use libWMaker and so it is now Window Maker
specific application. :~)
