--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Using GNU autoconfig
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1.	Run   ./configure   to generate config.h and the various Makefiles.
	./configure --help   gives a list of possible options with slightly
	longer descriptions in README.configure

	Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that
	the `configure' script does not know about.  You can give `configure'
	initial values for variables by setting them in the environment.  Using
	a Bourne-compatible shell, you can do that on the command line like
	this:
	        CC=c89 CFLAGS=-O2 LIBS=-lposix ./configure
	Or on systems that have the `env' program, you can do it like this:
		env CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include LDFLAGS=-s ./configure
	Or if you're using a non Bourne-compatible shell, you can do:
		sh -c 'CFLAGS="-O2 -g" ./configure

  2.	set any other main preferences:
    	    Edit "src/feature.h"
	    Edit "config.h"   if you didn't use ./configure options
	    If you're cross-compiling, edit the following in "config.h"
		NO_XLOCALE
		SIZEOF_*	# sizeof some types
		R*INT*T		# types which are the same size
				# as 16bit/32bit/pointer

  3.	Build it (repeat step 2 as desired):
	    make

  4. 	Install wterm:
	    make install

	you may also want to install doc/etc/wterm.terminfo and 
	doc/etc/wterm.termcap

  5 a.	If compiled with UTMP_SUPPORT, you may need to install wterm setuid
	root or setuid/setgid to match the file permissions on /etc/utmp
  5 b.  You may need to install setuid root anyway for some systems so that
	they can give you ownership of the tty devices.

  6.	On systems which dislike doc/wterm.1
	    (cd doc; rm wterm.1; make wterm.1)
  	
		 ===================================

NB:	SunOS (with/without gcc?) gets reported by configure as

		#undef STDC_HEADERS
		#define HAVE_SYS_IOCTL_H 1

	but the ioctl() defines aren't protected against multiple
	inclusion, in this case by <termios.h> so use a hack in
	"feature.h" to avoid the problem.

	Gave up checking for `STDC_HEADERS', since they really should be
	there and I don't want to deal with the problems when they don't
	exist.

	SunOS users might complain to the right places and get their
	system headers fixed so that one day the rest of us won't have
	to keep compensating :(

	SVR4 users (that aren't using gcc) will have to add -DSVR4 to
	CPPFLAGS for configure.
